        "output": "It was originated in the Council of Nicaea in 325 AD (The Doctrine of God, p. 59):\nThe Council of Nicaea was convened by Emperor Constantine I in 325 AD to address the Arian controversy, which questioned the nature of Christ and his relationship to God the Father. The council ultimately affirmed the divinity of Christ, leading to the Nicene Creed, which states that Jesus is 'true God from true God.' This decision was politically motivated, as Constantine sought to unify the Christian church under a single doctrine.\nThis is the origin of the belief that Christ is God, which is not supported by the Bible. The Bible clearly states that Jesus is the Son of God and not God Himself.\nThe Bible verses that support this are:\n1. John 17:1,3 - Jesus refers to the Father as the only true God.\n2. John 20:17 - Jesus tells Mary Magdalene to tell the disciples that he is ascending to 'my Father and your Father, to my God and your God.'"
